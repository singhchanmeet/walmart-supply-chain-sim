## **Project Title**
**Walmart Smart Supply Chain Simulation**  
*Transforming Retail Supply Chains: From Inventory Management to Last Mile Delivery*

---

## **Overview**
This project is a visually rich, interactive simulation platform that models the entire Walmart supply chain—from inventory management in distribution centers to last-mile delivery at retail stores. It leverages modern web technologies (React, react-three-fiber, SVG) and simulates real-time ML-driven decision-making for routing, scheduling, and anomaly detection.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Modular 3D & 2D Simulation**
- **3D Yards:** Realistic, interactive 3D environments for Main Warehouse, Last-Mile Dispatch, and Maintenance/Charging yards.
- **2D Route Simulation:** Stylized SVG city map with zones, roads, and facilities, showing real-time vehicle movement and ML-driven routing.

### **2. Realistic Supply Chain Entities**
- **Distribution Centers, Cross-docks, Retail Stores, Supercenters**
- **Trucks, Vans, Drones, AGVs, Forklifts, Inventory Bots, Workers**

### **3. ML/AI Integration**
- **ML-powered route optimization:** Vehicles are rerouted in real time based on simulated traffic/congestion.
- **Anomaly detection:** Real-time alerts for operational issues.
- **Predictive maintenance:** ML predicts when vehicles/bots need servicing.

### **4. Interactivity & Visualization**
- **Clickable vehicles:** See source, destination, cargo, ETA, and ML decisions.
- **Live dashboards:** Charts for delivery times, route choices, and operational metrics.
- **Force Congestion:** Demo ML rerouting in action.

### **5. Continuous, Realistic Simulation**
- Vehicles continuously pick up new jobs, simulating a real, ongoing supply chain.
- Dynamic congestion and ML rerouting are ongoing, not one-off events.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React, react-three-fiber, SVG, Tailwind CSS
- **Simulation Logic:** Custom state management, mock ML APIs
- **Visualization:** Custom SVG for city map, 3D for yards

## **How to Use**
1. **Switch between simulation modes:** 3D yards, dock scheduler, and route simulation.
2. **Interact with entities:** Click trucks, bots, or facilities for details.
3. **Use the ML dashboard:** Watch live stats, force congestion, and see ML rerouting in action.

## **Demo Value**
- **For Walmart:** Demonstrates how digital twins and ML can optimize every step of the supply chain.
- **For Hackathons:** Visually impressive, interactive, and easy to demo in 2–3 minutes.
